# HarmonicCoordinatesArticulation
implementation of the Harmonic Coordinates Character Articulation paper made by Pushkar Joshi et al. for creating and controlling volume deformations used to articulate characters
This implementation is made for the INF574 Analysis of shapes course at Ã‰cole Polytechnique

To build the project it is necesary to have the following directory structure:
Dir1/libigl
Dir1/HarmonicCoordinatesArticulation
Dir1/HarmonicCoordinatesArticulation/build

and in the build directory run cmake ../
